nQuake for Linux
================
To install nQuake, locate the installer tarball (nquakeXX_installer-linux.tar.gz
where XX is a number) and extract it.


$ tar xvzf nquake13b_installer-linux.tar.gz


The version of the installer may vary (in this case 20), so try typing nquake
and then pressing tab to let the console auto-complete the filename if you are
unsure.

Once you have extracted the package, change directory to the folder that was
created (same as the package but without .tar.gz), run the install script and
follow the instructions. You can use tab to auto-complete the folder name here
as well.


$ cd nquake20_installer-linux/
$ ./install_nquake.sh


After choosing what mirror to use for downloading, simply sit back and enjoy
a sweet cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice while nQuake downloads and
installs all the components needed to play QuakeWorld.

After installation has completed, start QuakeWorld by changing directory to
where you chose to install nQuake, and run ezquake-gl.glx.


$ cd ~/nquake/
$ ./ezquake-gl.glx

If you are interested in playing the full Quake game (singleplayer), you need
to buy Quake. From the Quake installation, copy pak1.pak to ~/nquake/id1/.

Thank you for downloading nQuake
